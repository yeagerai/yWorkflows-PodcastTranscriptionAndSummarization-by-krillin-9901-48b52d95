# Component Name
SaveOutputs

# Description
The SaveOutputs component is a Yeager component designed to save the transcript, summary, and summary audio of a podcast in their respective output files. It creates the specified output directory if it does not exist and saves each output in the appropriate format.

# Input and Output Models
- **SaveOutputsInputDict**: This input model is a Pydantic BaseModel with the following fields:
    - `PodcastTranscript`: A string representing the transcript of the podcast.
    - `PodcastSummary`: A string representing the summary of the podcast.
    - `PodcastSummaryAudio`: A bytes object representing the summary audio of the podcast.

- **TranscriptSummaryAudioResponse**: This output model is a Pydantic BaseModel with the following fields:
    - `transcript_file_path`: A string representing the file path of the saved podcast transcript.
    - `summary_file_path`: A string representing the file path of the saved podcast summary.
    - `summary_audio_file_path`: A string representing the file path of the saved podcast summary audio.

# Parameters
The component uses the following parameters, obtained from the component configuration file:
- `output_directory`: A string representing the path of the output directory where files will be saved.
- `transcript_filename`: A string representing the filename for the podcast transcript.
- `summary_filename`: A string representing the filename for the podcast summary.
- `summary_audio_filename`: A string representing the filename for the podcast summary audio.

# Transform Function
The `transform()` method of the SaveOutputs component takes an input argument `args` of type `SaveOutputsInputDict` and returns an output of type `TranscriptSummaryAudioResponse`. The implementation can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Create the output directory if it does not exist.
2. Save the input `PodcastTranscript` to the specified `transcript_filename` within the output directory.
3. Save the input `PodcastSummary` to the specified `summary_filename` within the output directory.
4. Save the input `PodcastSummaryAudio` to the specified `summary_audio_filename` within the output directory.
5. Return a `TranscriptSummaryAudioResponse` object containing the file paths of the saved podcast transcript, summary, and summary audio.

# External Dependencies
The component uses the following external libraries:
 - `os`: For handling file system operations and directory creation.
 - `yaml`: For parsing the component configuration file.
 - `fastapi`: For creating a FastAPI application and defining API endpoints.
 - `dotenv`: For loading environment variables.
 - `pydantic`: For defining and validating input and output models.

# API Calls
There are no external API calls made by the SaveOutputs component.

# Error Handling
Errors in the SaveOutputs component are primarily handled by Pydantic's BaseModel validation for input and output models. There are no specific exceptions or error messages thrown within the component.

# Examples
To use the SaveOutputs component within a Yeager Workflow, first define the necessary input data and configurations:
