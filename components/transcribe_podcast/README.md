# Component Name

TranscribePodcast

# Description

This component transcribes an audio file of a podcast using the Whisper ASR API. It takes a podcast audio file as input and returns the transcribed text as output.

# Input and Output Models

- **Input Model:** `TranscribePodcastInputDict` handles the input data of the component. It has one key `PodcastAudioFile` which holds the input audio file. The data type for this key is `Any`.
- **Output Model:** `TranscribePodcastOutputDict` handles the output data of the component. It has one key `PodcastTranscript` that holds the transcribed text from the audio file. The data type for this key is `str`.

Both models use Pydantic for validation and serialization.

# Parameters

- **api_key (str):** The API key for the Whisper ASR API. It is stored in environment variables and retrieved via `os.environ.get()`.
- **language_code (str):** The language code for the input audio file. This is read from the component's configuration file.

# Transform Function

The `transform()` method of the `TranscribePodcast` component executes the following steps:

1. Initializes Whisper ASR API headers with the provided `api_key` and `language_code`.
2. Sends the input `PodcastAudioFile` to Whisper ASR API for transcription.
3. Receives the transcription result from the Whisper ASR API.
4. Returns the transcribed text as `PodcastTranscript` within `TranscribePodcastOutputDict`.

# External Dependencies

- `os`: To read environment variables.
- `typing`: For type hinting.
- `yaml`: To read configuration data from YAML files.
- `dotenv`: To load environment variables from .env files.
- `fastapi`: To create FastAPI instances and serve the component.
- `pydantic`: To create input and output models for validation and serialization.
- `requests`: To make HTTP requests to the Whisper ASR API.

# API Calls

This component makes a POST request to the Whisper ASR API (`https://api.whisper.asr.example.com/v1/asr`) with headers containing the `api_key` and `language_code`. It then sends the input `PodcastAudioFile` as the request payload.

# Error Handling

The component relies on the FastAPI framework for error handling. Any errors that occur, such as invalid input data or issues during the API call, will be caught and handled automatically by FastAPI. Specific exceptions and error messages are not explicitly defined within the component.

# Examples

To use the `TranscribePodcast` component within a Yeager Workflow:

1. Set up a `.env` file with your `api_key` for the Whisper ASR API.
2. Provide a valid `language_code` within the component's configuration file.
3. Send a request to the `/transform/` endpoint of the component with a key `PodcastAudioFile` containing an audio file, such as:
