# Component Name

GenerateSummary

# Description

The GenerateSummary component is responsible for generating a summary of a given podcast transcript. This component makes use of the OpenAI GPT-3 API to provide an AI-generated summary of the provided text. It processes input data and returns the summary as output data.

# Input and Output Models

This component uses two data models for handling input and output:

## Input Model: GenerateSummaryInputDict

This input model takes the following parameter:

- `PodcastTranscript` (str): The input podcast transcript that needs to be summarized.

## Output Model: GenerateSummaryOutputDict

This output model returns the following parameter:

- `PodcastSummary` (str): The generated summary of the input podcast transcript.

The data models enforce validation and serialization using the Pydantic library's `BaseModel` class.

# Parameters

The GenerateSummary component initializes with the following parameters:

- `openai_api_key` (Optional[str]): The API key for accessing the OpenAI GPT-3 API, which is read from the environment variable "OPENAI_API_KEY".

# Transform Function

The `transform()` method of the GenerateSummary component has the following implementation steps:

1. Set the OpenAI API key using the `openai_api_key` parameter.
2. Format a prompt for the GPT-3 API using the input podcast transcript.
3. Call the GPT-3 API's `Completion.create()` method with the given parameters:
    - engine: "text-davinci-002"
    - prompt: The formatted prompt
    - max_tokens: 150
    - n: 1
    - stop: None
    - temperature: 0.5
4. Extract and process the response text from the API call.
5. Create an instance of `GenerateSummaryOutputDict` with the processed response text as `PodcastSummary`.
6. Return the output dictionary.

# External Dependencies

The GenerateSummary component has the following external dependencies:

- `openai`: The package for interacting with the OpenAI GPT-3 API.
- `dotenv`: The package for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.

# API Calls

The GenerateSummary component makes an external API call to the OpenAI GPT-3 API using the `Completion.create()` method. This call provides the API with the formatted prompt created from the input podcast transcript, requests a summary with a limited number of tokens (150), and controls the output generation using the temperature parameter (0.5).

# Error Handling

The component uses the Pydantic `BaseModel` class for validating and serializing input and output data. Any errors due to incorrect formatting or required fields missing in the input dictionary will raise validation errors.

Regarding the OpenAI API call, any exceptions raised by the API (e.g., incorrect API key, exceeding API limits, etc.) will need to be caught and handled by the user implementing the workflow.

# Examples

To use the GenerateSummary component within a Yeager Workflow, create an instance of the component and pass the input dictionary to the `transform()` method, as shown in the code block below:
